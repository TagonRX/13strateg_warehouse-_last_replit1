# Warehouse Management System

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive warehouse management system designed to streamline inventory tracking, stock management, and operational analytics. It offers role-based access for warehouse workers and administrators. Key capabilities include individual and bulk stock intake with barcode assignment, location-based picking, real-time inventory tracking, warehouse capacity monitoring, daily picking list management, robust worker performance analytics, and a complete event audit log. The business vision is to optimize warehouse operations, reduce manual errors, and provide actionable insights for improved efficiency and cost savings.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React 18 with TypeScript and Vite. It leverages Radix UI primitives and shadcn/ui components ("New York" style, inspired by Carbon Design System) for a consistent and modern look. Typography is based on IBM Plex Sans/Mono, and the color palette is optimized for operational clarity, supporting both light and dark modes. Key UI patterns include role-based sidebar navigation, responsive design, card-based interfaces, real-time toast notifications, and resizable, persistent table columns. Barcode scanning is integrated, supporting both USB scanners and mobile camera inputs.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, using TypeScript and ES Modules. It exposes a RESTful JSON API with session-based and Bearer token authentication, featuring role-based middleware. Drizzle ORM manages PostgreSQL database interactions. The project follows a monorepo structure, sharing TypeScript types and utilizing Zod for schema validation. Real-time communication is handled via a WebSocket server for features like remote scanning and picking list synchronization. A unique auto-location extraction feature derives warehouse locations from SKUs.

### Feature Specifications
*   **Inventory Management**: Supports bulk imports, real-time updates, location consistency checks, and comprehensive price tracking. An archiving system records all inventory changes.
*   **Cost Analytics**: Tracks costs through event logs for stock-in/out operations and worker performance.
*   **Picking Lists**: Manages daily picking lists with enhanced CSV/Excel/URL import capabilities, global credentials for multiple sources, and persistent selections. Manual collection is also supported.
*   **Warehouse Loading View**: Provides dynamic filtering and configuration of warehouse settings for capacity analysis.
*   **User Management**: Includes basic user administration with robust deletion safeguards.
*   **Event Logging**: A comprehensive audit trail captures all warehouse operations, including product testing, stock movements, and user actions, with full product information and cost traceability.
*   **Worker Analytics**: Displays key metrics and cost totals for all users.
*   **Barcode Scanner Workflow**: Supports dual-mode scanning (USB and Phone) with a "zero-leak" routing algorithm for USB scanners and WebSocket integration for mobile camera scanning via a dedicated "/scanner-mode" page.
*   **Product Testing Workflow**: A two-phase system for incoming products, tracking items from pending tests to final condition (Used/Exdisplay/New/Parts/Faulty) with working hours analytics for faulty items.

### System Design Choices
The database schema, managed by Drizzle ORM, includes tables for users, inventory, event logs, worker analytics, picking lists, SKU errors, CSV sources, global settings, and a dedicated workflow for product testing (pending_tests, tested_items, faulty_stock). UUID primary keys and automatic timestamps are used, with foreign key relationships for data integrity. Product deduplication is achieved by `productId`, and upsert patterns handle bulk inventory updates.
